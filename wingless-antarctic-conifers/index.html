Gondwanaland has begun to break up for good, and the antarctic continent is drifting to the bottom of the world. It's getting colder and colder.
<br />

<br />
Everything remaining on Antartica lasts a while longer, until South America drifts far enough away to allow a cold current, driven by the winds, to encircle the entire continent. Warm winds can't break through very often, and the entire continent gets colder and colder until it is entirely covered in ice. Everything that lived there dies. You can't evolve sufficiently to live in those conditions in that time frame.
<br />

<br />
Luckily, as South America and Australia broke off, some of you lived on. As long as there is enough diversity within a species, unless out-competed for resources, it will live.
<br />

<br />
In order to improve your chances further, you might like to enlist the help of the new creatures on the block... birds. Birds can eat your seeds and, if they survive digestion, drop them a distance away. Obviously the birds will only do this if they get something out of the deal, and you will only benefit if the seeds survive, so you will need to provide tough seeds, in a sweet package. To put that shortly: fruit.
