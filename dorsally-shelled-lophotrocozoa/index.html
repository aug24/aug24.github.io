With a shell above, and a shell below, you're safely protected, and can open and close to permit feeding, and to hide.&nbsp; When the shell is open, you filter feed happily.&nbsp;<br /><br />As 'babies' dorsally shelled lophotrocozoa float around until they have accreted enough material in their shells to sink to the bottom.&nbsp; At the floating stage they are called plankton.&nbsp; Ideally, they eventually end up in places where there is a slight current to carry food to them.<br /><br />If you land on a nice rocky shelf, you can build nice big shells and reproduce happily and safely for a long time.&nbsp; You don't want to get swept away though.<br /><br />If you land on soft mud, this isn't going to work so well.&nbsp; You may get covered with silt, over time, which makes filter feeding difficult.&nbsp;<br /><br />On rock, you can ensure you don't move by poking a sticky bit of your body - a 'pedicle' - out through your hinge and gluing yourself down.&nbsp; On mud, you need stilts! These take the form of extending your bottom shell into a long cone, and growing two long 'legs' near the front called 'helens'.&nbsp;Together these form a triangular prop, enabling you to lift your mouth up out of the mud, and continue to feed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously stilts on rocks are no good, and sticky pedicles on mud don't work either.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="../hyoliths/index.html">Helens</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="../brachiopods/index.html">Pedicles</a>?<br /><br /><br />
