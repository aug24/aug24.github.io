<p>If you don't want the cost of a shell, then as simply a small worm with an efficient central nervous system and a frilly mouth, then you'll need to find some other way to survive as a species. There are lots of ways to achieve this really - you can move faster, eat and reproduce faster, or fight back.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>The main way that you move is by squeezing the muscles in your abdomen to wriggle along. Your head gets pushed in front of you, and your gut just drags along behind. If you increased the number of muscles you have, that might work.</p>
