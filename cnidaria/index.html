Another random mutation, and a marvellous new cell type appears. Initially, these will have been only slightly useful, but over millennia they have mutated and mutated, with each change which makes them more powerful spreading throughout the population until they become amazing.

<br />
The cnida cell sits on the surface of the outer skin and contains a fine tube, coiled up, waiting. When the outer surface of the cell is touched, a part of the cell containing calcium ions ruptures and releases calcium into the interior of the cell. This causes a massive inrush of water via osmosis, and the change in pressure forces the tube out straight, becoming several times longer than the original cell. Spear fishing!

<br />
Any small food particle, such as plankton, which is carried close enough past you gets impaled and is then available to slowly pull in and digest.

In order to improve your efficiency, you could now do one of two things. Stay still, somewhere food is plentiful (hopefully staying that way) or swim with the current, where you can find food sources.
