<span style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.1;">You stick to the sea floor, spearing passing food and slowly growing. &nbsp;This is a quite successful strategy, and enables you to grown (slowly) into one of the biggest entities around at this time. &nbsp;As you grow, however, you will need a strategy for organising your body so that you remain efficient. &nbsp;No point in growing a new 'mouth' immediately behind another one.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.1;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">A set of genes arrives, by chance, that cause you to grow in certain patterns, instead of simply amorphously.&nbsp; Among other things, they impose radial symmetry on your polyps.&nbsp; Too many degrees of symmetry will be over complex.&nbsp; Too few will be inefficient. Having some genes for one kind of symmetry mixed with some for another will not be as useful as picking one type and sticking with it, and eventually all the examples of your kind with a mixture will be out competed.&nbsp; The two successful strategies turn out to be eight-fold symmetry and six-fold symmetry.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 12px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 12px;"><a href="../alcyonaria/index.html">Higher?</a></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 12px;"><a href="../zoantharia/index.html">Lower?</a></span></div><ul style="font-family: Verdana, Lucida, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.3; list-style: none outside none; margin: 0px; padding: 15px 5px 15px 0px;"><li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.1;"><br /></li></ul>
