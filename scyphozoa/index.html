You have become one of the 'true' jellyfish (although there is no particular reason to consider them more specifically jellyfishy than any one of the sister clades you would have reached with a slightly different choice).
<br />

<br />
You swim freely in the world's oceans, although you're not really strong enough to swim against any noticeable current. You are fairly a passive consumer of plankton and very small creatures, such as fish and crustacean, which stray into your stinging, poisonous tentacles.
<br />

<br />
You have a two part lifecycle - the familiar free floating 'medusa' stage, and a larval stage which sits quietly on the sea bed, and either transforms into a medusa or buds one or more medusa off it.
<br />

<br />
You are found from the shallow warm waters of the world's shore-bound seas, to the dark, cold depths of the oceans, in hundred of species, limited only by your need to stay in salt water... for now. 
<br />

<br />
Who knows what changes the next mutation will bring?
