A flower shape, which collects passing food, with a stem, sometimes short, sometimes long, and a gut that loops back, is a pretty good shape. 
<br />

<br />
Your 'stem' grows longer and longer, so you can reach more food, passing it to your central mouth via many tiny 'tube feet'. Some of you flip over, abandon your stem altogether and roam around, using your tube feet to move. You develop armoured plates which protect you from predators. 
<br />
<i>
<br />
</i><i>However</i>, we have now reached the Mesozoic era, and some seriously large animals are now roaming the oxygen-rich Earth. They have recently evolved jaws, which are good for crushing your armour. Do you want to get into an arms race, and get bigger and harder armour plating, or live fast, eat well, and die young, having reproduced as fast as possible?
