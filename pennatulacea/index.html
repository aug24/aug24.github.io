<p>Doing without both skeleton and sclerites leaves you as a worm-like tubular coral, with frilled filter feeding equipment at the 
top, and a bulbous, anchoring foot at the bottom, which makes some of you look a little like old fashioned quill pens.<p>

<p>You prefer to live in smooth-flowing deep water, with a deep sediment for you to bury your foot in.  If you find there isn't 
enough food where you are, you can let go, and float to a new location, where you will anchor.<p>

<p>You are unusual in the modern world in that your body exhibits 'glide reflection', where your features are arranged symmetrically,
but one side is shift up or down slightly.<p>

<p> You live quietly in seas all over the world: you are a Sea Pen.<p>
