Free-living, quickly-reproducing, sunlight-eating cells rapidly become one of the most successful lifeforms on the planet. They invade every niche, and are responsible for one of the first non-physics-driven forms of climate change: they reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hugely, and cause the extinction of many oxygen-intolerant early forms of life.

They are first clearly present around 2.5 billion years ago, and survive to the present day in great quantities in many locations, from the blue-green algae which blooms on the Mediterranean to the camouflaging bacteria which turns sloths fur dark green.
