Instead of the pollen cell swimming to the egg, the next best thing is for the egg to reach out to the pollen. Ovule cells inside the plant are more likely to be fertilised if they are close to the surface, but this makes them exposed. Slowly, a change evolves that delivers the best of both worlds: the ovule moves further inside, but grows behind it a tube which the pollen cell is transported down.

While we're on the subject of tubes, you're full of them: little tubes along which sap flows providing water to the leaves. You could improve upon that though, and transport water directly. All you need are more, smaller, tubes which will 'suck' water up via capillary action.
<br />

<br />
You'll need to grow thicker walls in some long thin cells, then when the cells die, the walls will remain, giving you tubes of lignin.
