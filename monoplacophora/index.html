With only one domed shell, and a tasty body underneath it, you look quite like a limpet, but are not very closely related.  You
can't move very fast, but as long as you stay away from the bigger predators, you're fine.

The safest place for you is grazing on rocks in the deep sea, where you live quietly till the present day.  You live so
deep that it was thought you were extinct for many years, until you were rediscovered, or at least re-identified, in the
early 1950s.

You are a monoplacophoran.
