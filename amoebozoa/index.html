<p>You are a member of the amoebozoa phylum. You reached this exalted position about a billion years ago, and have carried on till today. Some of you are well known, such as the slime mould family, or the amoeba proteus with its visible pseudopodia.</p>

<p>All of you have single cells, and can take on 'dry' forms when conditions are not good. Some of you (slime moulds) create specialised sub-copies of yourself already in dry form, called spores. These are used similarly to seeds, in the hope of eventually arriving somewhere better.</p>

<p>Some of you enjoy living in the guts of animal from time to time, which makes them pretty ill. All in all, a good spread of approaches ensures that this group will survive for a long time yet.</p>
