You are a member of the amoebozoa phylum.&nbsp; You reached this exalted position about a billion years ago, and have carried on till today.&nbsp; Some of you are well known, such as the slime mould family, or the amoeba proteus with its visible pseudopodia.<br /><br />All of you have single cells, and can take on 'dry' forms when conditions are not good.&nbsp; Some of you (slime moulds) create specialised sub-copies of yourself already in dry form, called spores.&nbsp; These are used similarly to seeds, in the hope of eventually arriving somewhere better.<br /><br />Some of you enjoy living in the guts of animal from time to time, which makes them pretty ill.&nbsp; All in all, a good spread of approaches ensures that this group will survive for a long time yet.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
