<p>Pine trees sweep across most of the mountains of the northern hemisphere. They are adapted with soft, springy branches which tolerate the weight of snow, and sap which will not freeze.</p>

<p>They are used for many kinds of interior wood work, and are associated with pagan religious observation in Europe and North America.</p>

<p>They can even be eaten - the Adirondack area of the United States takes its name from the Adirondack Indians. This was a nickname given by the neighbouring tribes meaning 'tree eaters', due to their habit of eating and drinking parts of the pine tree, chewed, or as a tea.</p>
