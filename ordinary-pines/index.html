Pine trees sweep across most of the mountains of the northern hemisphere. &nbsp;They are adapted with soft, springy branches which tolerate the weight of snow, and sap which will not freeze.<br /><br />They are used for many kinds of interior wood work, and are associated with pagan religious observation in Europe and North America.<br /><br />They can even be eaten - the Adirondack area of the United States takes its name from the Adirondack Indians. &nbsp;This was a nickname given by the neighbouring tribes meaning 'tree eaters', due to their habit of eating and drinking parts of the pine tree, chewed, or as a tea.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
