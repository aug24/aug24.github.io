<p>From here on in, it's a question of live fast, die young, leave a good looking cell.</p>

<p>Bacteria colonise everywhere on Earth, from the deepest ocean to the highest cloud forest, inside trees, outside trees, inside animals, on the skins of animals, everywhere.</p>

<p>Some get thicker outer walls, and become gram-positive, some thinner and become gram-positive. Some become parasites that live on, or in, larger creatures. Some become spiral shaped, and others learn to shape-shift dramatically as a means of locomotion.</p>

<p>They are arguably the most successful life form on the planet. </p>
