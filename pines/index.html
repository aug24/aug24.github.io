<p>Pine trees are the predominant softwood of the Northern Hemisphere, found over all continents, especially in well drained, acidic soils, to which they are better adapted than other plants.</p>

<p>They have no hard wood, and very sticky sap. The sap is also... quite flammable. At some stage in history, they must have been having a problem with forest fires, because a rather interesting adaptation turns up: sealed cones.</p>
