<p>Gondwanaland has gone. Broken up into two or three pieces, the species found on each section will split and change, and form new, distinct species.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Here, on the southern section, near the bottom of the world, you are fine, adapted for cold mountainous regions, but on an Antarctica which is still warm and not iced over. It is heading for the bottom of the world, but still attached to what will become South America.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Nearer the south pole, the winds are stronger. If only your seeds would catch the breeze a bit better, they would get spread further, and could provide you with a small advantage for a tiny cost...</p>
