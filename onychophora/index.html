<p>You become a larger and faster worm. By modern times, you can move at about 0.1 miles per hour, and have become an efficient hunter of insects and other small creatures.</p>

<p>You are still clearly a worm, because although you have what look like legs on the sides of your segments, they are only ever moved in pairs, so there is no real 'walking' gait. You actually move much like an ancestral worm, but those paired 'legs' have gained the ability to flex slightly and actively grip on slippery surfaces.</p>

<p>You are a velvet worm.</p>

<i>That's as far as you can evolve here! </i>
