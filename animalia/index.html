<span style="font-family: inherit;">This is the beginning of the animals, although you would be hard put to realise it. &nbsp;At present you are an amorphous blob of cells, with digestive capabilities spread over the external surfaces. &nbsp;You survive only in sea water, where sufficient nutrients pass by you that you can live. &nbsp;You are, oddly enough, rather like a giant, multicellular bacterium. &nbsp;It's odd how certain approaches to life appear again and again, at different scales and with different mechanisms, but the same behaviours.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">And like all forms of life, if you don't find a niche that no-one else can use and occupy it, you will be squeezed out by other forms which do. &nbsp;You need to improve your ability to take in nutrients. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The strategy so far has been bigger and bigger balls of cells, but that is reaching its limits.&nbsp; Perhaps the balls could split into loosely connected clumps and allow fluids to flow between them?&nbsp; Or just keep getting bigger and bigger?</span><br /><br /><a href="../sponges/index.html"><span style="color: black; font-family: inherit;">Let the water flow through me.</span></a><br /><a href="../solid-animals/index.html"><span style="color: black; font-family: inherit;">Keep me strong and solid</span></a>
