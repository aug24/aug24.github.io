<p>This is the beginning of the animals, although you would be hard put to realise it. At present you are an amorphous blob of cells, with digestive capabilities spread over the external surfaces. You survive only in sea water, where sufficient nutrients pass by you that you can live. You are, oddly enough, rather like a giant, multicellular bacterium. It's odd how certain approaches to life appear again and again, at different scales and with different mechanisms, but the same behaviours.</p>

<p>And like all forms of life, if you don't find a niche that no-one else can use and occupy it, you will be squeezed out by other forms which do. You need to improve your ability to take in nutrients. </p>

<p>The strategy so far has been bigger and bigger balls of cells, but that is reaching its limits. Perhaps the balls could split into loosely connected clumps and allow fluids to flow between them? Or just keep getting bigger and bigger?</p>
