Chance mutations cause a useful chemical to be expressed by your genes: Phycobilin.
<br />

<br />
It doesn't have the sugar-creating part of chlorophyll, but both of them are chromophores (light capturing chemicals). If a phycobilin is attached to chlorophyll by a phycobiliprotein, then light from a much larger part of the spectrum can be used. In fact, green, yellow, orange and blue light can be used, leaving only red to be reflected. That's very efficient, and enables red algea to grow high in nutrients and proteins.
<br />

<br />
So high, in fact, that other animals find them very nutritious. Oh.
<br />

You might want to get <b>serious</b> about protection.
