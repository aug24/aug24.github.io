You have evolved into the well known group of trees which produce seeds in cones (in latin, cone-bearing is 'conifer').
<br />

<br />
As ever, the drive is to become more efficient and take over more of the world. You're already tall, producing multiple seeds from a single cone, and dropping those over the widest possible area.
<br />

<br />
There's a limit to how big and heavy a cone can grow on your branches, but increases in efficiency mean that you might be able to provide more nutrients to each cone. As the seeds themselves are only a tiny fraction of the weight of the cone, an ideal mutation to have now would be to produce two seeds behind each scale instead of one. Each seed will be a bit smaller, which might not be helpful, but there will be twice as many. What do you think?
