Mosses grow across the world, wherever there is (sometimes) moisture.<br /><br />Spagnum moss has even managed to colonise the acidic water found over the surface of peat bogs. &nbsp;In order to do this it has developed another mutation - dead cells containing water supplies.<br /><br />In growing quickly, wherever there is damp, mosses have become an important part of the process of greening. &nbsp;Mosses grow over newly damp ground and keep moisture in, which enables other plants to follow.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
