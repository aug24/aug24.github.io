You can afford to keep a lot of different genes around now, so you can survive pretty much wherever you go, on whatever you find.<br /><br />However, you're one of the smallest, weakest life forms around, because at this time, the eukaryotes, with their big, multi-layered walls, have grown up.&nbsp; They like eating you, like a little snack.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be nice to be big and tough like them?&nbsp; Well you might have the options: what if you get inside one in a failed snack attack, and stay in there, acting like a little chemistry factory, making food for them?&nbsp; Better to feed than be food?&nbsp; Or better to stay on the outside, maybe get faster, or hide away?<br /><br /><a href="../eukaryota-engulfee/index.html">Join a gang?</a><br /><a href="../free-living-bacteria/index.html">Play your own game?</a>
