You can afford to keep a lot of different genes around now, so you can survive pretty much wherever you go, on whatever you find.
<br />

<br />
However, you're one of the smallest, weakest life forms around, because at this time, the eukaryotes, with their big, multi-layered walls, have grown up. They like eating you, like a little snack.
<br />

<br />
Wouldn't it be nice to be big and tough like them? Well you might have the options: what if you get inside one in a failed snack attack, and stay in there, acting like a little chemistry factory, making food for them? Better to feed than be food? Or better to stay on the outside, maybe get faster, or hide away?
