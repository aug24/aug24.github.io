<div style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As the ball of cells gets bigger and bigger, it loses structural integrity, like a partially inflated ball.&nbsp; Smaller balls are OK, but bigger ones are likely to dent.&nbsp; That’s what happens to you.</span></div><div style="color: #666666; min-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Luckily, this turns out to have an advantage!&nbsp; At the back of the dent, water is trapped, and food particles don’t just whoosh past, they stop, and can be eaten.&nbsp; This is the beginning of some sort of digestive tract.&nbsp; The dent becomes deeper and deeper, and begins to look more like a sac, edged with cells which specialise in pulling in food and lined with cells that specialise in eating food.&nbsp; Anything that can’t be digested has to come out the same way.</span></div><div style="color: #666666; min-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Further improvements develop, giving you the ability to pull the ‘mouth’ closed.&nbsp; It’s a rudimentary set of muscles and nerves - not a central nervous system yet, but something that might one day develop into one.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: #666666; min-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The same types of specialised cells which line the mouth could occur in other parts of the body, creating a sort of fringed edge which would help - as the water goes around your edges, you can maximise your surface area with a frill, which will increase the proportion of useful food items you can grab out of the stream.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><a href="../comb-jellies/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Get frilly?</span></a><br /><a href="../solid-smooth-animals/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Stay smooth?</span></a>
