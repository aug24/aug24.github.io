<p>You're pretty tough, and you can eat what you find and look after yourself. As time passes, and the soup dries up, you develop into a set of different unicellular species, many of which are parasites living in the guts or blood of animals.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You cause a host of problems, including sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. Thanks a lot. In many species, the arrival of the insects helped you out enormously as they became blood-suckers, because they transport you from host to host. </p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You survive into the present day, but only as long as the creatures you live on or in are around.</p>
