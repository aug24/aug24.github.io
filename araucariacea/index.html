<p>You don't develop fruit. You remain, a very tough, long lived, hardy tree. Possibly due to the genetic drift caused by living in very cold climes for millenia, you have become a slow growing, long lasting, big seed making, very tall tree.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>This successful approach to reproduction is exactly at odds with the flowering plants which are your main rivals at this time. This means that your survival is reliant on not competing for resources with them.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>As it happens, once established, you will be around a very long time, which means that you do well in places where intermittent disturbances knock the flowering plant back for a while, allowing your new plants to get to a sufficient size, whereupon they will continue for centuries.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>In the new landmasses of New Zealand, for example, with their seismic activity and occasional forest fires, you do very well. Eventually you become the biggest tree in the area, and in fact, one of the biggest trees in the world.</p>
