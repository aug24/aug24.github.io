<span style="font-family: inherit;">One lucky little prehistoric worm with a gene error expresses a hard protein in its skin, called chitin.&nbsp; In many other situations this would a problem, making the animal stiff, and slow, and easy prey, and so the gene would die out, but at this point in time it’s just the thing.</span><br /><div style="min-height: 14px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Animals with this gene are slightly protected against assault by hunting jellyfish, and after a few generations, selection pressure causes a group to develop with a cuticle - a harder covering than normal ectoderm cells, which aids escape from stinging, grabbing predators.</span><br /><div style="min-height: 14px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As you grow, however, this cuticle can’t grow with you, so another mutation rapidly spreads through the population - at intervals, the cuticle is disconnected from the cells producing it, and a new, softer, larger cuticle develops underneath it.&nbsp; Eventually the old cuticle is sloughed off, and you stretch out inside your new armour.&nbsp; You are briefly vulnerable while the new cuticle softens, but behaviours such as hiding or burrowing rapidly develop.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">At this time, a ‘worm’ is basically a long slim tube comprised of two types of muscle.&nbsp; Circular ones, which squeeze from side to side and make you lengthen, and a single longitudinal muscle which can shorten the whole length of you.&nbsp; The first set of muscles contract in groups to extend the front, then the back, then the front again.&nbsp; It’s simple but it works.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; Differentiating the groups more strongly might improve the separation of contractions, and enable a slightly faster gait.</span><br /><div style="min-height: 14px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Would you like to develop rings which break up your body into segments?&nbsp; They will cost a little to make…</span><br /><div style="min-height: 14px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="../unsegmented-cuticle-worms/index.html">I’m smooth</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="../panarthropoda/index.html">I’m chunky</a></span><br /><div><br /></div>
