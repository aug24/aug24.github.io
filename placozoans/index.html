You had muscles, and nerves, and specialised cells within you. &nbsp;But they're not enabling you to survive, floating in the water. &nbsp;In an example of evolution reversing direction, you lose all those features in favour of a flattened, simplified body, which crawls very slowly across smooth surfaces using flagella.<br /><br />You are 'under the radar' for a food source for the other animals. &nbsp;You survive, almost unnoticed into the present day, and are only recognised as an animal in the late 1800s.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
