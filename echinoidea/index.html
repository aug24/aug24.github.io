You simply can't stop big jaws from crushing you. &nbsp;But you can make it so unpleasant that these newly evolved predators will choose someone else. &nbsp;The flat plates you already have become lumpy, and bumpy, and unpleasant to put in your mouth. &nbsp;As time passes, those lumps and bumps get pointier and pointier, until you look like an explosion in a needle factory.<br /><br />You are a sea urchin - a round-ish body covered in pointy spines. &nbsp;You roam around the ocean from the tidal zone down to around three miles down, and very few creatures will eat you. &nbsp;Those that do - crabs and lobsters, triggerfish, eels, humans - &nbsp;avoid the need to bite down with soft mouthparts on spines by having special adaptations such as strong claws or bony mouths. &nbsp;Or hammers.
