<p>Gondwanaland may be breaking up, but you don't care. Carried away from the far south of the world inside the bodies of birds, you recolonise the remainder of the planet as the ice age ends. </p>

<p>Your trees grow across the continents and up into the northern hemisphere, but you are still reliant on wind to spread your pollen, so any tree which grows a long way from another of the same kind may never be able to reproduce. In mitigation, living a very long time makes it more likely that you will find a friend.</p>

<p>You could either live longer, or spread pollen further?</p>
