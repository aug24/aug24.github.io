You make thicker and thicker armour from the calcium carbonate dissolved in sea water. &nbsp;It keeps you safe - for now.<br /><br />You float on the end of your 'stalk' or 'holdfast', a small, five-sided ball, with a mouth on the top, and a bum on one side as far down as possible to take advantage of gravity. &nbsp;On each of your sides, you grow an armour plate, and you filter feed in the shallower waters of the prehistoric world. &nbsp;Many of you are eaten by creatures who have evolved jaws, but you grow fast enough to spread far and wide. &nbsp;It's a good balance between the cost of armour and speed of reproduction. <br /><br />We know of you now as one of the most common fossils of the Cambrian era, showing that there were uncountable billions of you. <br /><br />Sadly, we can't know of you as a living species, because something quite bad happens around 252 million years ago: the planet either gets hit by a huge space rock, or super-volcanoes explode, and the climate changes rapidly. &nbsp;The seas change, becoming a little more acidic, and you can't make the plates of calcium-carbonate armour any more. <br /><br />You all die. &nbsp;All the uncounted billions of you.<br /><br />On the other hand, you're not alone, because around half of all life forms on the planet also die. &nbsp;This is the Permian-Triassic extinction event, commonly known as The Great Dying. &nbsp;It will take millions of years for the planet to recover.
