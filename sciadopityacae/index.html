<p>The only single seeded conifer present in the northern hemisphere, out competed by other plants, especially pines, you were stranded, around 230 million years ago.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Constant pressure on your numbers squeezed you out of almost every niche, until, in the present day, you are found only on the islands of Japan.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You are a 'living fossil'.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>On the other hand, you are one of the five sacred trees of Japan, you are planted in temple gardens and palaces, and your slow growing, very dense wood is highly prized. So, not all bad.</p>
