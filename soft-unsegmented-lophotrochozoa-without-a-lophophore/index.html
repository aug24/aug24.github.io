OK. You don't want to run away. You don't want to eat and reproduce as fast as possible. We're running out of options here. You can either get help, or fight back, by eating other things, the bigger the better. The improved nutrition from eating other, bigger, organisms will enable you to get bigger and stronger, but there is another choice - you can hide away somewhere with a decent food source and keep going on what you can eat in secret.
