<p>Increasingly frilly edges, covered with sticky cells develop on your outer surfaces and enable you to gain a rapid advantage in water. You experience a substantial increase in efficiency and are able to grow rapidly bigger than other animals similar to you.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Eventually, the frilly edges, known as cilia, become big enough that you can actually use them to swim with, instead of just floating with the current. This enables you to become a predator, following and eating other animals, which are actually your close relatives! This is a common feature of predation: the best animals to eat are ones which are fairly closely related, because they share the same chemical make-up and so are the best match you to your needs.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Eventually, the large variation of size means that you become many different species, each tuned to a particular form of hunt. Some of the largest of you effectively form swimming mouths, with stiffened cilia acting as teeth. </p>
