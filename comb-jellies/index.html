Increasingly frilly edges, covered with sticky cells develop on your outer surfaces and enable you to gain a rapid advantage in water. &nbsp;You experience a substantial increase in efficiency and are able to grow rapidly bigger than other animals similar to you.<br /><br />Eventually, the frilly edges, known as cilia, become big enough that you can actually use them to swim with, instead of just floating with the current. &nbsp;This enables you to become a predator, following and eating other animals, which are actually your close relatives! &nbsp;This is a common feature of predation: the best animals to eat are ones which are fairly closely related, because they share the same chemical make-up and so are the best match you to your needs.<br /><br />Eventually, the large variation of size means that you become many different species, each tuned to a particular form of hunt. &nbsp;Some of the largest of you effectively form swimming mouths, with stiffened cilia acting as teeth. <br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
