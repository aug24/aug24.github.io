<p>As you crawl along, you sometimes stop and rear your little wormy head up into the passing water. A nice little plankton occasionally drifts into your mouth as a result. A bigger mouth develops, which makes this more likely, and the edges of the mouth become frilly with cilia edgings, which wave in passing food.</p>

<p>You crawl less and less, and while you rear up your head, you dig your tail down to help you stay anchored.</p>

<p>When you create eggs, your larvae are free swimming until they find a good place to live, at which point they start to change shape, and excrete a glue which helps them stay still. There you will stay for life, often in a small colony of similar, possibly even related, filter feeding worms called Pterobrachia.</p>
