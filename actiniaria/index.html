A small mouth, sitting atop a column which attaches you to the rock, staying in areas where the currents bring the food right past you, and spearing whatever comes too close, you are a pretty effective hunter.

<br />
Although you are good to eat for some species, such as sea stars, sea slugs, and turtles, most species won't eat you because you sting them. You hide in the cracks in the rocks, and withdraw your tentacles to look inconspicuous, when the need arises.
<br />

<br />
If you really need to get away, you can actually let go of the rock, and, by flexing your body around your hydrostatic ball of stomach, swim to another location. Some species in fact have adapted to spend their entire lives floating.

You are a sea anemone.
