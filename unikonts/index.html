<p>Sticking with one flagellum is a safe bet. More might enable more complicated movements, but will cost more. Anyway, now you've made the choice and been successful, it's really hard to change it back unless you or your environment changes in such a way that it would be even better. It does happen sometimes, but rarely, and only when it becomes advantageous. That's evolution for you.</p>

<p>At a microscopic scale, water is pretty viscous. You can pull yourself through it like helicopter blades, or push through like a boat's propellor. Trying to keep the ability to do both won't be as successful as choosing one.</p>

<p>Will your flagellum <a href="../amoebozoa/index.html">pull </a>or <a href="../opisthokonts/index.html">push</a>?</p>
