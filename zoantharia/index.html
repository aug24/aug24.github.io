You have repeating groups of six sections, and you live on the ocean floor. A stabby cnidarian, living off passing phytoplankton, in the high competition of the seas.
<br />

<br />
The competition to survive is always fierce, and every bit of energy you can get is worth having. Some of the food floating around you is able to make its own food from sunlight - and you can't do that. Maybe you'd like to team up with them and get a boost?
<br />

<br />
Obviously, this option is only useful if you are currently living in the shallow, sunlit seas. The speciation occurs because not everyone can take advantage of the opportunity.
