Hacrobia are tiny algae, divided into two main groups, the cryptomonads and haptophytes.
<br />

<br />
They spread throughout the world's oceans and fresh waters, and are hardly noticed at all, being some of the tiniest life forms on the planet.
<br />

<br />
They are, however, food for some of the largest lifeforms on the planet, where they are better known as part of the grouping called plankton.
