As your leaves grow, they now spread and cast a much larger shadow. They become substantially more efficient and you can carry on growing despite the continually reducing carbon dioxide levels.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Your leaves now spread and look like what we would think of as a leaf. They are called Megaphyll leaves.
<br />

<br />

<br />
You're still reproducing by spreading spores. Spores are tiny cells which, if they happen to land somewhere where they can start growing, will become new plants.
<br />

<br />

<br />
There is a mutation which means that spores won't be sent out into the world alone... how about if, when two cells divide and combine to create new spores, the 'spare' cells comes along for the ride? Then it could provide an extra degree of energy stores which would give the new plant a head start, perhaps make them able to grow enough that they can become full plants even if they land in less hospitable places.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This will mean that the cost of making each potential new plant will go up - whether or not it will be successful.
<br />

<br />

<br />
What you gonna do?
