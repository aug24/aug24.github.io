Hmm. &nbsp;It's all very well being free-floating stinging blobs, drifting into food-rich waters, but that can't be quite enough. &nbsp;What happens if you drift into a still water area where there is no food?<br /><br />Over time, those of you who wiggle a bit when you get stuck have a better survival rate, and pass on your genes, and the wiggle improves until you are able to swim, albeit very slowly.<br /><br />This takes a very very long time, and during that time, other animals have developed. &nbsp;You are now also a marvellous passing snack for other creatures.<br /><br />Perhaps you need a defence of some kind? &nbsp;Would a shell work?<br /><br /><a href="../conulariida/index.html">Shelled jellies</a><br /><a href="../shell-less-jellies/index.html">Shell-less jellies</a>
