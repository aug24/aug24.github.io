<p>Hmm. It's all very well being free-floating stinging blobs, drifting into food-rich waters, but that can't be quite enough. What happens if you drift into a still water area where there is no food?</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Over time, those of you who wiggle a bit when you get stuck have a better survival rate, and pass on your genes, and the wiggle improves until you are able to swim, albeit very slowly.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>This takes a very very long time, and during that time, other animals have developed. You are now also a marvellous passing snack for other creatures.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Perhaps you need a defence of some kind? Would a shell work?</p>
