This is terrible. &nbsp;The comb jellies and the jellyfish, both close relatives, are now <i>both</i> hunting you down and eating you! &nbsp;You need to do something to avoid the threat.<br /><br />In a highly stressed situation, for a small group, evolution occurs quickly, because there are fewer individuals. &nbsp;Thus the likelihood of a gene spreading across a whole population is therefore higher.<br /><br />There are typically two evolutionary choices: you can chuck out things that aren't needed to increase your efficiency, or you can evolve rapidly in a dwindling population and find something that works. <br /><br />The risk of the first one is that you might become so simple that you lose the advantages you have got to date. &nbsp;The risk of the second is that you don't find a solution before the population becomes so small that it isn't viable.<br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"><div><a href="../bilateria/index.html">Increase complexity?</a></div><div><a href="../placozoans/index.html">Decrease complexity?</a></div></div>
