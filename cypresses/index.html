<p>With one small mutation, giving you two ridges, one down each side of your seeds, you gain a slightly better distribution from each plant than before. This is enough to help you cross continents, one seed fall at a time, over tens of thousands of years.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>But there might be a better way, or at least a faster way.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Time has passed in the animal kingdom too, and there are now creatures called birds. They like seeds. Sometimes they eat the seeds, fly a long way, and then poop out the seed still in good enough condition to grow and become a new plant. That's a lot better than being blown an extra thirty or fifty feet!</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You could encourage the birds to help...</p>
