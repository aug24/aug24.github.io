<div style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Selection pressure makes you get bigger and bigger, because being big makes you less likely to be eaten.&nbsp; You develop another kind of cell which is neither a specialised feeding cell for the inside surface or a specialised outside cell for the outside surface, but a specialised inside cell to fill you up.</span></div><div style="color: #666666; min-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do you remember how we described the big ball of cells as a dented ball?&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the new kind of cell, the dents just get deeper and deeper.&nbsp; Eventually, they get so deep that the dent becomes more than a mouth, it actually punctures through the back of the animal, and the animal becomes a tube.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This tube shape will be very efficient, as you can keep pushing food in at one end and let what you canâ€™t use fall out the back.&nbsp; Obviously, you only want to expend the energy to develop sensory, food-pulling cells at one end, as it would be inefficient to have them at both, so the next choice is simple: pick a direction.&nbsp; Is the first dent going to be the mouth or the anus?</span></div><div style="color: #666666; min-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #666666;"><a href="../protostomia/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mouth?</span></a></div><div style="color: #666666;"><a href="../deuterostome/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Anus?</span></a></div><div><br /></div>
