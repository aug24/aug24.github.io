<p>Instead of staying long and smooth like a worm, you develop bands around the body which give you a segmented shape. Each segment develops a thicker part like a claw on each side. Four segments are found to give the best results, three with two 'claws' each for walking, slowly, and one at the back which can be used to hold on to whatever you are living on.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You spread around the world, living in all sorts of conditions from the deep ocean to the high mountains. You are almost <b>unbelievably </b>tough! You can endure dehydration, radiation, temperatures only one degree above absolute zero and well above boiling point.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>That 'slow walk' gives you your name: Tardigrades, commonly known as water bears.</p>
