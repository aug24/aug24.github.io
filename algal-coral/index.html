Yep, that's right: even algae can grow a shell if the right chance mutations happen. In seawater, there's a certain amount of dissolved calcium. Algal coral luckily evolved a mechanism for fixing calcium to carbon and oxygen to express calcium carbonate.
<br />

<br />
On any patch of exposed rock in shallow water, there's likely to be thin layer of crusty, reddish, stuff. That's an algae, hiding inside a shell.
<br />

<br />
It doesn't make huge reefs, like polyp coral, but given enough time, it probably would. Two utterly different species, kingdoms apart, have evolved exactly the same mechanism to solve the same problem.
