<br />
Ferns, far from being the woodland undergrowth plant found in temperate climates, are actually found all over the world. They are simple, spore-reproducing plants, with efficient photosynthesising leaves which can flourish in a wide variety of places, from desert to drainage ditch.
<br />

<br />
They are remarkably tough. They can live on ground which is unsuitable for anything else; tolerate the presence of heavy metals; endure blazing sun and the cold of the desert night.
<br />

<br />
They are an important food plant for many smaller creatures, and have survived almost unchanged from the Carboniferous period to the present.
