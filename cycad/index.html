The Cycads look like someone glued a large fern to the top of a palm tree trunk. In fact, when new leaves grow, they look remarkably like ferns, as they emerge rolled up and unfurl slowly.
<br />
They have remained unchanged since the Permian era, becoming long lived plants with water storage inside their fleshy trunks which enable them to survive during dry times, and when they reproduce they can produce enormous cones, up to 300mm high, containing dozens of large seeds. Some of them have developed a sort of tap root, and can actually be larger under the ground than above.
