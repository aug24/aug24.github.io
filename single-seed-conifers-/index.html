<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;">At this time in history, most of the land is present in one large landmass called Gondwanaland. &nbsp;Conifers spread across it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;">But eventually, under the influence of tectonic plate activity, Gondwanaland begins to break up. &nbsp;This leads to an example of speciation by literally drifting apart. &nbsp;Some single seeded conifers stay on the northern section, others on the southern. &nbsp;Inevitably, these identical trees are going to split into two different species, as their continued adaptation to their environment will mean that by the time they meet again, in a few million years, they will no longer be able to fertilise each other.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;"><a href="../sciadopityacae/index.html">North?</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;"><a href="../antarctic-conifers/index.html">South?</a></span><br /><div><br /></div>
