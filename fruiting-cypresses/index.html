<p>Instead of thin, dry scales forming a cone to protect the seeds, you now want something succulent and attractive to attract your new helpers - so long as it doesn't cost too much.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>The scales fill out, the cones shrink, and take on the form of a berry containing a tough seed.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You are a Juniper tree.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Aided by the birds, you are carried around the world. Your distinctive, slightly sweet, fresh taste is approved of by more than just birds - the berries are collected and used by humans over thousands of years.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>The ancient Egyptians collected Juniper berries, and valued them highly enough to use them as burial gifts. The Greeks used them for medicine.The Dutch use them to flavour gin.</p>
