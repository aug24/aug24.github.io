<p>
Keeping both your valves, or shells, keeps you safe.  You're quite hard to eat, and that gives you enough time to grow and reproduce.
</p>

<p>
As a strategy, this is a success. as long as the mineral content of the sea remains constant.  You spread throughout the oceans, from
the top to the bottom, in a huge variety of shapes and sizes comprising mussels, clams, oysters and many more.
</p>

<p>
You survive to the present day, happily filter feeding from within your open shell, then closing up when threatened.
</p>

<p>
The only threat to your existence has come from a rather unexpected quarter: humans.  As the humans colonised the planet, and increased
the carbon in the air by curning coal and oil, some of that burnt carbon - carbon dioxide - dissolved into the sea.  That makes 
carbonic acid, which makes the whole sea slightly acidic, which erodes your valves, making them weaker.
</p>

<p>
Who knows, you may evolve some more, to make a thicker shell.  Or the rising acidity of the sea may kill you all.
