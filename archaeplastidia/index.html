<br />
You eat a photosynthesising bacterium. It's tasty food. However, over time, you have found that allowing the photosynthesising bacteria to live for a little while inside you makes them even better, as they can continue photosynthesising and making sugars inside you.
<br />

<br />
In fact, you have evolved to provide the chemicals the photosynthesising bacteria needs as food to extends its life inside you and maximise your meal
<br />

<br />
This adaptation has now reached the point where you can contain multiple photosynthesising bacteria and they can live on inside you indefinitely.
<br />

<br />
You have entered a symbiotic relationship, and will come to rely on your guest, providing food and protection, for the price of a few sugars.
<br />

<br />
Your guest photosynthesises using a chemical called 'chlorophyll a', which turns you a blue-green colour and gives you a supply of sugars all the time you are in sunlight. It doesn't absorb all the sunlight though - only a part - the rest is wasted.
<br />

<br />
The usual copy-error effect - inside the guest living inside you - can give you the ability to make a slightly different version of chlorophyll which will work using a different part of the sunlight spectrum, but it means you'll make less of chlorophyll a. Interested?
