Each of your five arms develops arms of its own. &nbsp;Those arms develop even smaller arms. &nbsp;This repeats until your arms fill the gaps between them like a filigree. When you hold them out, they look like a fine mesh basket, which gives you your name: a Basket Star.<br /><br />Beautiful, but mostly unseen, living in the deep cold waters of the northern hemisphere of the planet, &nbsp;you crawl across the ocean depths, hiding during the day, and feeding during the night. &nbsp;You are a pitiless hunter, grabbing krill - small swimming creatures - &nbsp;in your basket and eating them.
