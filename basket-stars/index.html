<p>Each of your five arms develops arms of its own. Those arms develop even smaller arms. This repeats until your arms fill the gaps between them like a filigree. When you hold them out, they look like a fine mesh basket, which gives you your name: a Basket Star.</p>

<p>Beautiful, but mostly unseen, living in the deep cold waters of the northern hemisphere of the planet, you crawl across the ocean depths, hiding during the day, and feeding during the night. You are a pitiless hunter, grabbing krill - small swimming creatures - in your basket and eating them. </p>
