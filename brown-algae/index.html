Accidentally creating a molecule similar to chlorophyll a, but absorbing a slightly different part of the spectrum enables you to grow slightly bigger, and colonise deeper water. It also turns you brown. We call it 'chlorophyll c'.

The best known example of a brown algae is kelp. Huge forests of the biggest variety, giant kelp, grow in the polar and temperate oceans, up to fifty metres long, growing over half a metre a day. They provide the ocean equivalent of rainforest, with different species of animals living at different depths.

There is one odd thing about brown algae: there are no known single celled brown algae. Nobody knows why (yet).
