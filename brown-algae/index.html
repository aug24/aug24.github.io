<p>Accidentally creating a molecule similar to chlorophyll a, but absorbing a slightly different part of the spectrum enables you to grow slightly bigger, and colonise deeper water. It also turns you brown. We call it 'chlorophyll c'.</p>

<p>The best known example of a brown algae is kelp. Huge forests of the biggest variety, giant kelp, grow in the polar and temperate oceans, up to fifty metres long, growing over half a metre a day. They provide the ocean equivalent of rainforest, with different species of animals living at different depths.</p>

<p>There is one odd thing about brown algae: there are no known single celled brown algae. Nobody knows why (yet).</p>
