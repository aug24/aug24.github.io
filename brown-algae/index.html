Accidentally creating a molecule similar to chlorophyll a, but absorbing a slightly different part of the spectrum enables you to grow slightly bigger, and colonise deeper water.&nbsp; It also turns you brown.&nbsp; We call it 'chlorophyll c'.<br /><br />The best known example of a brown algae is kelp.&nbsp; Huge forests of the biggest variety, giant kelp, grow in the polar and temperate oceans, up to fifty metres long, growing over half a metre a day.&nbsp; They provide the ocean equivalent of rainforest, with different species of animals living at different depths.<br /><br />There is one odd thing about brown algae: there are no known single celled brown algae.&nbsp; Nobody knows why (yet).<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
