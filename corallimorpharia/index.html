<p>As time passes, and the 'big mouth' strategy starts to pay off, you grow a larger and larger, flattened disk shaped 'mouth' on top of a small column, which anchors you to the sea bed.</p>

<p>You become mushroom shaped, except that the top of the mushroom is covered in tiny stinging tentacles arranged in radial rows out from the central mouth. You are more mouth than anything else.</p>

<p>You are quite difficult to eat, because any animal getting too close is stung, and so you live a good length of time. Some of your kind evolve even further, to express poisons which make you a poor choice of food indeed.</p>

<p>You are a corallimorph.</p>

<i>That's as far as you can evolve here! </i>
