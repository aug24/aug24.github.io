<p>As each individual in your species develops, its cells divide, grow and differentiate, forming a tube shape with a front and a back, symmetric sides and different kinds of cells. Cells which will form the sensory apparatus which the animal uses to hunt and eat appear on the opposite side to the initial dent, which lengthens until it eventually bursts through in the centre, creating a tubular gut with sensory apparatus at one end, and an anus at the other.</p>

<p>The sensory apparatus is currently quite simple, detecting food and closing the mouth, then opening it again once the food has been consumed. Over time, it will become more sensitive, enabling you to choose between two options: detect traces of larger food animals which have passed nearby, which you can expend energy to go and fetch, or stay still and wait until you detect smaller particles.</p>
