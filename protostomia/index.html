You develop a complete, or partial but long, gut, which forms backwards from your mouth.<br /><br />You have a front and a back, and you are symmetric from side to side. &nbsp;You look pretty worm like, and live in the bottom of the ocean, where you develop the ability to creep along and consume whatever is in front of you. &nbsp;This makes you quite recognisable as a primitive animal. &nbsp;You are &nbsp;several millimetres long when fully grown.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's still quite small as far as some other creatures go. &nbsp;The various jellyfish which developed before you would quite like to grab you, sting you to death, and eat you. &nbsp;You're going to need to be tough. &nbsp;Or fast. &nbsp;Which is it?<br /><br /><a href="../ecdysozoa/index.html">Toughen up.</a><br /><a href="../soft-protostomia/index.html">Shift up a gear.</a>
