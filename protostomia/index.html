<p>You develop a complete, or partial but long, gut, which forms backwards from your mouth.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>You have a front and a back, and you are symmetric from side to side. You look pretty worm like, and live in the bottom of the ocean, where you develop the ability to creep along and consume whatever is in front of you. This makes you quite recognisable as a primitive animal. You are several millimetres long when fully grown.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Unfortunately, that's still quite small as far as some other creatures go. The various jellyfish which developed before you would quite like to grab you, sting you to death, and eat you. You're going to need to be tough. Or fast. Which is it?</p>
