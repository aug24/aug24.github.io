Fight back! Alright! Let's do this. 
<br />

<br />
You hide in the mud at the bottom of the sea, and wait.... when something yummy passes by, you turn your entire face inside out and stab them with a small, venom bearing, sting. To eat them, you wrap your face around them and turn it back in again, drawing them inside, then go back to hiding in the mud.
<br />

<br />
Some of you develop long tails, anchoring you deep into the mud, where you stay for a lifetime. Others swim or crawl on a slime trail between meals. Hardly any of you are food for other animals. 
<br />

<br />
It's a successful approach... if you like that sort of thing.
