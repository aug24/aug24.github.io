<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">With your densely packed DNA, you can afford to express a lot more proteins. &nbsp;There is some serious evolution (without splitting into species) in the next few million years. &nbsp;In no particular order:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul><li>your DNA stops being stored in a loop. &nbsp;Instead, you develop end caps called telomeres which act like the bits on the end of shoelaces that stops them unravelling.</li><li>You get bigger. &nbsp;Much bigger. &nbsp;</li><li>Instead of 'stealing' genes in the process of eating other chaps similar to yourself, when a pair of you meet up, one 'gives up' some genetic material to the other.</li></ul><div>If this last one sounds crazy, because the organism giving up material will lose out, you have to remember that genes are survival machines both in themselves, and in groups. &nbsp;In this case, the gene may well get the chance to make many more copies of itself when it joins with a new set of partners.</div><div><br /></div><div>To facilitate all of these things, one major change takes place: the cell wall becomes less thick, and eventually forms a cell membrane.</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, you need to move around - your food demands are so high that you can't just wait around and hope. &nbsp;To this end, any change which makes you able to move, no matter how small, will be copied around the community. &nbsp;Eventually, those small changes add up to something called a flagellum.<br /><br />However, this flagellum needs a lot of energy. &nbsp;In order to make enough energy, you need to eat, which is done by engulfing smaller things, prokaryotes, until eventually something odd happens... &nbsp;you eat one, and it survives. &nbsp;Inside you. &nbsp;Ewwwww. &nbsp;The prokaryote inside you lives on, and, protected by you from most other threats, eventually loses the genes it isn't using. &nbsp;What is left, is a pretty simple thing, no longer an organism, but an organelle. &nbsp;It's called a mitochondrium.<br /><br />After all this, finally there is a choice again:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><a href="../bikonts/index.html">Grow another flagellum?</a><br /><a href="../unikonts/index.html">No thanks, one is enough!</a>
