<p>You have repeating groups of eight sections, and you live on the ocean floor. A stabby cnidarian, living off passing phytoplankton, in the high competition of the seas.</p>

<p>In order to obtain as much food as possible, when you mature, you anchor yourself in the best food providing currents you can find. However, this can leave you exposed to predators. You are, after all, still just a squishy bundle of grub to something a lot bigger than you, even if you have little stingers.</p>

<p>Perhaps something that makes a hard skeleton will make it more difficult to chew you up?</p>
