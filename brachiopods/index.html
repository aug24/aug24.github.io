<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Growing a pedicle allows you to attach yourself to a convenient location when you find&nbsp;yourself in one, and become 'sessile' or permanently stuck to one place. &nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">You can stay there, opening your shell and filter feeding when it's convenient, and closing it again to hide inside when there is a predator around. &nbsp;You release many, many tiny copies of yourself, which float around with the currents until, in their turn, they find a good place and stick themselves there, where they grow thicker and thicker shells and make more copies. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Interestingly, since the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which didn't&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">quite</i><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;wipe you out, you haven't grown back as rapidly as a closely related species, the bivalve&nbsp;molluscs. &nbsp;As a result, they appear to have dominated the upper, richer, waters, and you are mostly found at deeper locations.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">It's a simple, relatively low cost way to make efficient use of free&nbsp;resources, and you are found in deep seas all over the world.</span></div>
