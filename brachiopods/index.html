<p>Growing a pedicle allows you to attach yourself to a convenient location when you find yourself in one, and become 'sessile' or permanently stuck to one place. </p>

<p>You can stay there, opening your shell and filter feeding when it's convenient, and closing it again to hide inside when there is a predator around. You release many, many tiny copies of yourself, which float around with the currents until, in their turn, they find a good place and stick themselves there, where they grow thicker and thicker shells and make more copies. </p>
<p>Interestingly, since the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which didn't <i style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">quite</i> wipe you out, you haven't grown back as rapidly as a closely related species, the bivalve molluscs. As a result, they appear to have dominated the upper, richer, waters, and you are mostly found at deeper locations.</p>
<p>It's a simple, relatively low cost way to make efficient use of free resources, and you are found in deep seas all over the world.</p>
