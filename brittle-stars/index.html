<p>A neat, small central body with serpentine arms reaching out from it enables you to move rapidly across the ocean floor, grabbing on to whatever you can to pull yourself around. However, your relatively small body prevents you from eating anything sizeable, and so you remain a detritus feeder, scavenging your way around the deep seas of the world. You are a Brittle Star.</p>
