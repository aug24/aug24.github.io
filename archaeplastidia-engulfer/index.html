<p>You eat a photosynthesing bacterium.  It is tasty food.  Over time, you have been letting lifeforms like it live on inside you for a little while, because it can continue photosynthesising and making sugar while inside.</p>

<p>In fact, you evolve a little more to provide the chemicals it needs as food to extend its life inside you.</p>

<p>This adaptation reaches the point where you can contain multiple photosynthesing bacteria, and they can live on inside you indefinitely.</p>

<p>You have entered a symbiotic relationship, and will never live without photosynthesising bacteria inside you again, giving food and protection, for the price of a few sugars.  You are effectively a single organism.</p>

<p>Inside you, the bacterium photosynthesises using a chemical called 'Chlorophyll A', which turns you a blue-green colour and gives you a supply of sugars all the time you are in sunlight.  It doesn't absorb all the sunlight though - only a part - the rest is wasted.</p>

<p>The usual copy-error effect can give you the ability to make a slightly different version of chlorophyll which will work using a different part of the sunlight spectrum, but it means you'll make less of chlorophyll a.  Interested?</p>
