<p>That frilly mouth of yours we just mentioned? It's pretty good. One of the easiest ways to evolve is to do something you've already done - but even more.</p>

<p>You grow frills on your frills!</p>

<p>The super-frilly mouth is called a 'lophophore'. You can hide away in the mud, and slide out your frilly frills and quietly eat whatever passes by. As time passes you adopt many shapes, but all basically mud-hiding, filter-feeding, hard little worms.</p>
