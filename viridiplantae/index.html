After creating 'chlorophyll b', you can use more of the light spectrum and grow faster. You're still in the sea, but some of you happen to be in tidal areas where you dry out when the water goes away.
<br />

<br />
This is mostly acceptable - the benefits of lots of light are balanced by the damage done by drying out - except for your reproductive cells. Currently, when you release new cell clusters which will grow into new plants - the earliest form of seeds - they sink to the bottom and grow in the ocean.
<br />

<br />
Now that you are invading tidal zones, they get thoroughly dried out and irradiated by ultra-violet light before the sea comes back. This is enough to damage the important DNA inside them and prevent the new plants from growing.
<br />

<br />
If you want to hang out in the tidal zone, you'll need to keep the sun off them.
