<p>You are eaten by a corticata.  It thinks you are tasty food.  Luckily, over time, it has been letting lifeforms like you live on inside it for a little while, because you can continue photosynthesising and making sugar while inside.</p>

<p>In fact, it has evolved to provide the chemicals you need as food to extend your life inside it.</p>

<p>This adaptation has now reached the point where it can contain multiple photosynthesing bacteria, and they can live on inside it indefinitely.</p>

<p>You have entered a symbiotic relationship, and will never live outside again, getting food and protection, for the price of a few sugars.  You are effectively a single organism.</p>

<p>Inside your host, you photosynthesise using a chemical called 'Chlorophyll A', which turns you a blue-green colour and gives it a supply of sugars all the time you are in sunlight.  Chlorophyl A doesn't absorb all the sunlight though - only a part - the rest is wasted.</p>

<p>The usual copy-error effect can give you the ability to make a slightly different version of chlorophyll which will work using a different part of the sunlight spectrum, but it means you'll make less of Chlorophyll A.  Interested?</p>
