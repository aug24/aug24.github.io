With fruit being carried hundred of metres away, lone trees are emerging which may never be able to reproduce and are therefore wasted effort. &nbsp;As the seed <i>must</i> be grown on the female plant, it's up to the male to find a better technique to bridge the gap by sending its pollen further.<br /><br />Adaptations emerge which are advantageous, and spread throughout the population.<br /><br />The female cone has already become so highly adapted that it is hardly recognisable as a cone. &nbsp;Now it is the male's turn. &nbsp;Cones become longer, thinner and lighter, more able to wave in the wind and throw their pollen rather than simple drop it. &nbsp;In effect, in an example of convergent evolution (where two or more species solve similar problems in similar ways, but using entirely different genes), the cone has become almost indistinguishable from a catkin.<br /><br />Pollen grains become smaller and smaller, till they are as light as possible. &nbsp;At the same time, they develop slight ridges along the sides which will help them catch the wind and spread further, hopefully encountering a female plant.<br /><br />Reproduction is now possible over greater distances, and your species longevity is assured. &nbsp;A conifer ('cone bearing') tree which no longer bears recognisable cones on either of its sexes!<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
