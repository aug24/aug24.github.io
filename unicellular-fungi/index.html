Unicellular Fungi comprise a group of organisms of which the best known are the yeasts and penicillins.
<br />

<br />
There is a huge number of varieties of yeasts, and they are found on almost any external surface of any fruiting plant. When making cider, for example, there is no need to add yeast as the crushed apples will have had yeasts on the surface.
<br />

<br />
Penicillins are part of a family of blue-green fungi. They also grow everywhere, aided by their ability to kill bacteria which are trying to compete with them for food.
<br />

<br />
Both have been adapted for use by humans, providing us with our daily bread, and our best defence against infection.
