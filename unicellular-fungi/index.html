Unicellular Fungi comprise a group of organisms of which the best known are the yeasts and penicillins.<br /><br />There is a huge number of varieties of yeasts, and they are found on almost any external surface of any fruiting plant.&nbsp; When making cider, for example, there is no need to add yeast as the crushed apples will have had yeasts on the surface.<br /><br />Penicillins are part of a family of blue-green fungi.&nbsp; They also grow everywhere, aided by their ability to kill bacteria which are trying to compete with them for food.<br /><br />Both have been adapted for use by humans, providing us with our daily bread, and our best defence against infection.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
