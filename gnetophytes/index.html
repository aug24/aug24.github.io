The development of 'vessel elements' allows you to grow longer and longer. &nbsp;You don't need to have as much wood now, as you can lean on other tall plants and still pump water up. &nbsp;Slowly, most varieties &nbsp;lose the wood and become creepers.<br /><br />In the Cretaceous era, the Gnetophytes were a wide ranging and varied group of plants which must have been worthy of several entries on their own to describe their speciation. &nbsp;However, since then, they have slowly declined until now there are only a few varieties remaining. &nbsp;Most are creepers in the arid parts of the Americas. &nbsp;One is a tree growing in the tropics. &nbsp;One is a desert plant growing in Central Africa - which only ever grows two leaves, but they are metres long.<br /><br />Who can guess how they came to be so distinct?<br /><br />If you can, please let me know...
