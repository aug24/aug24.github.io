<p>You live in the sunless seas of the deep ocean, and a few shallow but sunless sounds.</p>

<p>You grow very slowly, but you live a very long time indeed. Some of you are known to be over four thousand years old.</p>

<p>Your outer shell grows thick, and hard, and dark. Inside, your cnidarian colours are very bright indeed.</p>

<p>Your shell is sought after by humans as it can be polished to a brilliant shine, and is hard to get.</p>

<p>You are a Stony Coral.</p>
