You live in the sunless seas of the deep ocean, and a few shallow but sunless sounds.
<br />

<br />
You grow very slowly, but you live a very long time indeed. Some of you are known to be over four thousand years old.
<br />

<br />
Your outer shell grows thick, and hard, and dark. Inside, your cnidarian colours are very bright indeed.
<br />

<br />
Your shell is sought after by humans as it can be polished to a brilliant shine, and is hard to get.
<br />

<br />
You are a Stony Coral.
