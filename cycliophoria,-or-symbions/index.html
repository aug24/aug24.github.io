Hidden away, deep in the cold oceans of the world, you stick close to the source of food you have adopted and adapted to: tiny fragments of food dropped by lobsters. &nbsp;You have reduced in size, presumably to make sticking close to a lobster easier, and are now less than a millimetre in length.<br /><br />Yes, you eat the crumbs from lobsters' dinners, by gluing your sac-like body to the mouthparts of a lobster, and waiting for something to fall your way. &nbsp;Luckily, lobsters, like most relatively large carnivores, are messy eaters, and very few species actually eat them, so you have managed to get food and safety sorted at one step.<br /><br /><br />
