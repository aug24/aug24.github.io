<p>A shell is a useful addition. There's far too many things out there bigger than you willing to gobble you up. The way you make yours is fascinating.... You develop a special set of cells on your outside called the mantle. These contain proteins which extract calcium carbonate from sea water, then express it on their outer surfaces (with a little bit of protein to provide a scaffold). This makes a hard surface just outside your body, which makes you a little less attractive as food.</p>

<p>As you grow older, this layer grows thicker and thicker. However, it's a bit of a restriction, as you can't actually flex this stuff - it's just too hard. Over many generations, a pattern emerges which gives you the best of both worlds - protection and movement. It is a simple hinge, which sits between two separate shell structures.</p>

<p>The hinge allows you to open the two parts of your shell to feed, and close it when there is danger. Perfect!</p>

<p>There are two effective ways to make the hinge. Your two shell cases can be:</p>


<ul><li> on your <a href="../molluscs/index.html">left and right</a> sides</li><li> on your <a href="../dorsally-shelled-lophotrocozoa/index.html">top and bottom</a> sides</li></ul>
