A shell is a useful addition.&nbsp; There's far too many things out there bigger than you willing to gobble you up.&nbsp; The way you make yours is fascinating.... You develop a special set of cells on your outside called the mantle.&nbsp; These contain proteins which extract calcium carbonate from sea water, then express it on their outer surfaces (with a little bit of protein to provide a scaffold).&nbsp; This makes a hard surface just outside your body, which makes you a little less attractive as food.<br /><br />As you grow older, this layer grows thicker and thicker.&nbsp; However, it's a bit of a restriction, as you can't actually flex this stuff - it's just too hard.&nbsp; Over many generations, a pattern emerges which gives you the best of both worlds - protection and movement.&nbsp; It is a simple hinge, which sits between two separate shell structures.<br /><br />The hinge allows you to open the two parts of your shell to feed, and close it when there is danger.&nbsp; Perfect!<br /><br />There are two effective ways to make the hinge.&nbsp; Your two shell cases can be:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>&nbsp;on your <a href="../molluscs/index.html">left and right</a> sides</li><li>&nbsp;on your <a href="../dorsally-shelled-lophotrocozoa/index.html">top and bottom</a> sides</li></ul><br /><br /><br />
