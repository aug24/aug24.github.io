Re-enabling the flagellum works perfectly: pollen cells land on the ovule and mature into sperm cells, growing a flagellum in the process, and then swim to the egg cell, where they fuse together and become a seed. The seed grows on the outside of an adapted part of the plant until it falls off, and hopefully grows into a new plant.

<br />
The problem is that there are lots of other plants out there, growing tall, and crowding you out. Your little new plants don't get enough sun and not too many of your potential offspring survive to maturity, so you need to get higher up, live for a long time, and drop as many seeds as you can.
<br />
One way to do this, is to only put your leaves and seeds at the top of the plant like a crown. The other way is to get tough. Attempting to do both won't work.
