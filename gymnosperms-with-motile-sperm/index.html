<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px;">Re-enabling the flagellum works perfectly: pollen cells land on the ovule and mature into sperm cells, growing a flagellum in the process, and then swim to the egg cell, where they fuse together and become a seed. &nbsp;The seed grows on the outside of an adapted part of the plant until it falls off, and hopefully grows into a new plant.</span><br /><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The problem is that there are lots of other plants out there, growing tall, and crowding you out. &nbsp;Your little new plants don't get enough sun and not too many of your potential offspring survive to maturity, so you need to get higher up, live for a long time, and drop as many seeds as you can.</span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">One way to do this, is to only put your leaves and seeds at the top of the plant like a crown. &nbsp;The other way is to get tough. &nbsp;Attempting to do both won't work.</span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="../cycad/index.html">Crown me</a></span></div><div style="font-size: 15px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="../ginkgo/index.html">Tough guy</a></span></div>
