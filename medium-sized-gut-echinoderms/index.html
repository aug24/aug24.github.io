Your gut fills up all the space inside you, but you don't grow to create space for a really really large gut. &nbsp;You can efficiently move around, find food, eat it, and digest it. &nbsp;But while you've been evolving, so has everything else: &nbsp;The Mesozoic Marine Revolution has arrived...<br /><br />Elsewhere, some fairly close relatives of yours have just developed something called a 'jaw'. &nbsp;It is a large, leveraged, crushing device, which means that even relatively tough creatures like yourself are vulnerable. &nbsp;These new-shaped creatures roam the oceans, spotting slow moving, armoured individuals of your species, pick them up and crush them to bits.<br /><br />You have a thick, armoured skin, but it's simply not enough to protect you against the big creatures who are evolving now. &nbsp;You can't really get tougher fast enough. &nbsp;In this arms race, increased toughness will lose to a bigger and bigger jaw, and more and more armour, until you look like a concrete block and you can't move at all. &nbsp;Some other approach may work, or you can just run away.<br /><br />What would make you really unpleasant to eat?<br /><br /><a href="../echinoidea/index.html">Spikes. &nbsp;All over.</a><br /><a href="../asteroidea/index.html">Save the weight and effort of growing spines, and just run away!</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"></span> <br /><div class="K3JSBVB-X-m" style="border: 0px; color: #888888; cursor: default; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-wrap: break-word;"><br /></div><div class="K3JSBVB-X-m" style="border: 0px; color: #888888; cursor: default; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-wrap: break-word;"><br /></div><div class="K3JSBVB-X-m" style="border: 0px; color: #888888; cursor: default; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-wrap: break-word;"><br /></div>
