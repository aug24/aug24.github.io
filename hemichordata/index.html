<p>You develop a fold in your gut layer which differentiates to become a simple neural cord. Now you can grow a longer body without one end losing touch with what is happening at the other. </p>

<p>You are an ocean living worm with a 'head' end which contains your organs, a mouth which sits behind that, and a 'tail' end which contains a long gut for extracting as much as possible from your food. For food, you will eat anything you find dead on the floor as you crawl along, or anything living which drifts in as you swallow water. Your nice long gut doesn't care.</p>

<p>Competition is tough, as always, and you need to collect more food to win. You can specialise in crawling, finding dead stuff on the floor, or stick your bum end in a hole and stick your head up to catch whatever is swimming past.</p>
