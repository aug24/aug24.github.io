<p>You remain a small worm, with an incomplete gut, which makes a living in the safe crevices of the world. </p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Many of you become flattened in order to maximise the rate at which oxygen travels through your skin, as you have no complex internal organs to pump blood or exchange gases. Some of you acquire a common name of 'tape worm' as a result of this shape.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Some of the crevices you hide in are inside other animals, and you become a parasite, causing disease and slow death, as well as damaging the brains and reproductive capabilities of your host. But what do you care? You've evolved to survive, and this tactic is working well for you.</p>
