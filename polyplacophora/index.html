Duplicating your central body parts enables you to move faster while still retaining your armour.  You
can graze on rocks in the sea and quickly hide when you need to.

This is a reasonable lifestyle, and you spread throughout the sea, thoughout the world, throughout the range
of depths from deep sea to tidal.

You are quite the success story.  Some varieties grow as large as a human hand, some remain quite small.  Some
are edible to humans.

Some of you develop crystaline eyes, some time in the last ten million years or so.  As far as we know, these 
aragonite based eyes were the last to evolve on this planet.  

With no true brain, it's not quite clear how you see the world, but you exhibit homing behaviours such as 
travelling back to the same spot to rest at night, so it appears your view of the world is quite complex!

You are a polyplacophoran, or chiton.
