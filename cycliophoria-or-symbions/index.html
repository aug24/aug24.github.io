<p>Hidden away, deep in the cold oceans of the world, you stick close to the source of food you have adopted and adapted to: tiny fragments of food dropped by lobsters. You have reduced in size, presumably to make sticking close to a lobster easier, and are now less than a millimetre in length.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Yes, you eat the crumbs from lobsters' dinners, by gluing your sac-like body to the mouthparts of a lobster, and waiting for something to fall your way. Luckily, lobsters, like most relatively large carnivores, are messy eaters, and very few species actually eat them, so you have managed to get food and safety sorted at one step.</p>
