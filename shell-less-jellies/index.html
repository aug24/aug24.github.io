Without a shell, perhaps being able to move faster would help? In order to do that, you need to expel water with more force. Simple physics suggests that increasing the size or strength of part of the body doing the squeezing is what you need. Jellyfish bodies are not really adaptable for strength, so a bigger squeezer is the best bet.

If you mutated to have an extra flap of body around the bottom of your umbrella section, that might work? Of course, bigger body means less is available for tentacles.
