This gives your offspring the opportunity to start rapidly photosynthesising as soon as they grow, and proves to be a very successful approach.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">You are still a rather amorphous green plant, with most cells capable of growing and splitting if they get sufficient light input. &nbsp;This means your structure becomes rather lobe-like, or blobby.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Annoyingly, this means that one lobe can shadow another lobe which is a complete waste of all the energy gone on making the lower lobe, which is now unable to collect light. &nbsp;You are effectively in competition with your own body.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you experience a mutation which turns off cell reproduction after a certain number of divisions, except for a few cells at the furthest tip of a lobe, then you will spread out further, and should be able to reduce the shadowing effect. &nbsp;If you don't you will possibly spread out more widely.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="color: #888888; font-family: inherit;"><a href="../liverworts/index.html">Blobby?</a></span><br /><a href="../apically-growing-land-plants/index.html"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pointy?</span></a></div>
