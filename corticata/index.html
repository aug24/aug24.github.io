Life is good inside your new tougher cortex.&nbsp; You swim around, eating things smaller than you.&nbsp; But some of the things you eat have got big enough and tough enough to survive inside you, if they're lucky.&nbsp; It could be to your advantage to have something living inside you, if it isn't in competition with your current chemistry.&nbsp; If it is, of course, you'll probably die.<br /><br />One thing that clearly isn't in competition with you is a green/blue&nbsp;photosynthesising bacterium.&nbsp; It eats light and makes simple sugars.&nbsp; If you took in one of those, it could share the sugar with you, and you could keep it safe from other predators.&nbsp; Win-win.<br /><br />The other choice is a rhodophyte, a primitive form of red algae. &nbsp;It doesn't make sugar, so it's not quite as rich a meal, but it makes a lot of other things of use.<br /><br /><a href="../archaeplastidia/index.html">Green!</a><br /><a href="../chromista/index.html">Red!</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
