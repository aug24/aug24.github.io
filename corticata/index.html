<p>Life is good inside your new tougher cortex. You swim around, eating things smaller than you. But some of the things you eat have got big enough and tough enough to survive inside you, if they're lucky. It could be to your advantage to have something living inside you, if it isn't in competition with your current chemistry. If it is, of course, you'll probably die.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>One thing that clearly isn't in competition with you is a green/blue photosynthesising bacterium. It eats light and makes simple sugars. If you took in one of those, it could share the sugar with you, and you could keep it safe from other predators. Win-win.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>The other choice is a rhodophyte, a primitive form of red algae. It doesn't make sugar, so it's not quite as rich a meal, but it makes a lot of other things of use.</p>
