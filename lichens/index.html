Some species of fungi will only grow to reproducing if they are in contact with a green algae. &nbsp;The green algae is surrounded by the fungi, which provide it with a good environment for photosynthesis.<br /><br />(The green algae can live without the fungi, but the fungi can't live without the green algae.)<br /><br />What's really interesting is that some of the fungi can live with more than one variety of green algae - and will grow into different body shapes depending which algae they absorb.<br /><br />We call these symbiotic systems 'Lichen'.<br /><br /><i>That's as far as you can evolve here! &nbsp;</i><br /><i>You can go back to the start with the link above, or share what you became with the icons below.</i>
