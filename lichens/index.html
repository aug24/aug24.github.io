<p>Some species of fungi will only grow to reproducing if they are in contact with a green algae. The green algae is surrounded by the fungi, which provide it with a good environment for photosynthesis.</p>

(The green algae can live without the fungi, but the fungi can't live without the green algae.)

<p>What's really interesting is that some of the fungi can live with more than one variety of green algae - and will grow into different body shapes depending which algae they absorb.</p>

<p>We call these symbiotic systems 'Lichen'.</p>
