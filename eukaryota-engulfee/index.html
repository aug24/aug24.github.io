Around you are lots of early eukaryotes, which engulf smaller things, such as you, a prokaryote, to steal their energy until eventually something odd happens... one eats one, and it survives. You're inside another organism. Ewwwww. You live on inside the prokaryote, and, protected by you from most other threats, eventually lose the genes you aren't using. What is left, is a pretty simple thing, no longer an organism, but an organelle. You are now called a mitochondrium, and you are part of a Eukaryote.
<br />
At this time, the Eukaryotes are large, sexual, organisms with a tail for swimming called a flagellum. Two are called flagella. One or two?
