<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Around you are lots of early eukaryotes, which engulf smaller things, such as you, a prokaryote, to steal their energy until eventually something odd happens... &nbsp;one eats one, and it survives. &nbsp;You're inside another organism. &nbsp;Ewwwww. &nbsp;You live on inside the prokaryote, and, protected by you from most other threats, eventually lose the genes you aren't using. &nbsp;What is left, is a pretty simple thing, no longer an organism, but an organelle. &nbsp;You are now called a mitochondrium, and you are part of a Eukaryote.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">At this time, the Eukaryotes are large, sexual, organisms with a tail for swimming called a flagellum. Two are called flagella. &nbsp;One or two?</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><a href="../bikonts/index.html">Two, for luck?</a><br /><a href="../unikonts/index.html">One is enough!</a>
