Slowly slowly, catchee monkey.
<br />

<br />
You don't need to hitch a ride to conquer the world. You can take it slow and steady, be the tortoise, not the hare.
<br />

<br />
So long as you live a long time, don't encourage other creatures to eat you, and drop a few successful seeds every year, you will do very nicely. And you do...
<br />

<br />
You are a very successful, famous family of plants. Cypresses without fruit grow very slowly, but life for an extraordinarily long time, becoming very, very large in the process.
<br />

<br />
Your numbers include the tallest trees (Coast Redwood), the most massive (Giant Sequoia) and the second widest (the Montezuma Cypress).
<br />

<br />
Some of your number live for thousands of years.
