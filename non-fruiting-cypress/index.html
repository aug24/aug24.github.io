<p>Slowly slowly, catchee monkey.</p>

<p>You don't need to hitch a ride to conquer the world. You can take it slow and steady, be the tortoise, not the hare.</p>

<p>So long as you live a long time, don't encourage other creatures to eat you, and drop a few successful seeds every year, you will do very nicely. And you do...</p>

<p>You are a very successful, famous family of plants. Cypresses without fruit grow very slowly, but life for an extraordinarily long time, becoming very, very large in the process.</p>

<p>Your numbers include the tallest trees (Coast Redwood), the most massive (Giant Sequoia) and the second widest (the Montezuma Cypress).</p>

<p>Some of your number live for thousands of years.</p>
