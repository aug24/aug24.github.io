<p>Well, if you're choosing to stay soft, you're going to have to live faster or quieter. You need to reproduce before you're spotted and eaten.</p>

<p>Maximising your eating area, by growing a wider and wider mouth would enable you to capture more prey, and be able to reproduce earlier. Alternatively, staying small, with the ability to pull your tentacles in and look just like a shiny rock might be effective.</p>

<p>Anything in between these two approaches won't work. A medium sized mouth that can't be hidden away will leave you obvious. Time to choose again.</p>
